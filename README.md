Masai Student Quiz Application Project

Hey everyone! In this file, we’re going to walk through how to build a simple and fun quiz application using Python!

First, we define our quiz questions as a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary contains a question, a list of options, and the correct answer.

Each question looks like this — it has a 'question', a set of 'options' labeled A to D, and the correct answer's letter.

The core of the application is the run_quiz function. It loops through the quiz list, prints each question and its options, and takes the user’s answer.

The application then checks whether the user’s answer matches the correct one and gives feedback instantly.”

At the end, it displays your final score out of the total number of questions.

Finally, last two lines ensures that the quiz runs when you execute the script directly.

And that’s it! This is a basic quiz app in Python.
